FULLY DEFLATIONARY - Litecoin Classic entirely removes mining from the equation by using direct acyclic graphs to secure and confirm transactions - no more centralised powers and fair distribution ensures that Litecoin Classic is fully deflationary; The supply is always a constant.

PAYMENTS - With Litecoin Classic, transactions are completely free - 0% fees. Furthermore, the network ensures that with more transactions, confirmations actually get faster; Making Litecoin the most scalable cryptocurrency in the history of decentralisation.

Due to the overwhelming influx of interest into the cryptocurrency industry, it is absolutely vital that cryptocurrencies are able to scale; With the current 'scrypt-based' system that litecoin runs on, many issues arise regarding scalability - the currency is limited to how many transactions that can get confirmed in a 'series' blockchain.

Litecoin Classic completely solves the issue of scalability by introducing a new, direct acyclic graph protocol that allows for hundreds of thousands of transactions to be confirmed per second.
